## v0.2.4
* Compatible with 0.6.6
* Remove attack/damage buttons as they are "used" even if not using ombo card.
* Put back ctl/alt/shift clicking on character sheet removed in 0.2.3
* With shift being verstatile attacks, now CTL-ALT substitutes for the "default" fast forward shift.
* Chat damage button disabled until other rolls complete, like attack or placing a template. Corrects problem case of rolling damage before rolling attacks.
* Identified, but have not fixed, MESS incompatibility, including with placed templates.
* Improved? background colored player names when highlighting cards.
* If not auto targeting we can wait until the damage roll is done before recording targets. This might enable a workaround for mess not working with midi-qol until a proper fix is found
  * Disable auto roll damage.
  * Let mess place the template
  * then roll damage.
* Set user on auto-rolled ability saving throws thanks @spoider

## v0.2.3
* If player rolled saves is enabled and a token is required to save that has default owner pemission (in addition to tokens ownd by a player) a player will be chosen to roll for that token.
* In merge cards critical hits/fumbles are now highlighted.
* Added a new weapon property "Magical" which is also checked when determining if weapon's attack is magical for damage resistance.
* Corrected a typo in the non-magical damage resistance check. Thanks @Jibby
* Fixed a bug that added all possible buttons to almost every chat card.
* Fixed "inventory button" standard roll to work exactly like a standard roll with no auto rolling.
* Coloring of chat card borders/names now gives npc rolls a GM color instead of the player color if the playere initiated the roll. Mainly relevant for saving throw rolls triggered by a player causing the NPC to save.
* Fix for webm tokens causing an error.
* Added require targets flag in config settings. If enabled items that require pre selected targets won't be allowed to proceed without a target being selected. (Better rolls not supported)

## v0.2.2
Made sure all paths are relative paths.

## v0.2.1
* Fix a saving throw bug where the first player saving throw was hidden.
* Fix a race condition that could case saving throw rolls to fail
* Fix an innacurate identification of a damage only workflow.
* Added the ability to set the token name text color OR background color when highlighting chat cards.
* Fixed inability to set range targeting flag.

## v0.2.0 [BREAKING]
* A big change to speed item rolls and auto shift click.  
Speed item rolls now makes no changes to the character sheet, and does not need module suport to work with token bars/macro hot bar. Instead when it is enabled the mouse event is recorded when you do the roll. **The meaning of the keys have changed**:  
  * ctrl = disadvantage attack
  * alt = advantage attack
  * shift means use versatile damage and ctrl/alt still work. I think this is a big improvement BUT **this is a change from both minor-qol and midi-qol. If it causes too much angst I will put back (as an option) the previous behaviour.**  
* AutoShiftClick has been renamed to auto fast forward and applies for attack and damage rolls. When enabled, if a roll would normally produce a dialog a normal roll will be made for attack rolls that have not been "speed" rolled. Damage rolls will be normal or critical if the attack hit and if the option is not set the dialog will be displayed.  
* Better rolls can now use the merge card.  
* A Bug fix for a better rolls edge case when auto checking saves with players rolling saves but not using LMRTFY.  
* Magic Items are now fully supported with speed rolls, advantage/disadvantage on magic item spells/feats and resource consumption works. The only oddity is when casting an area effect spell (.eg. fireball) the template is not automatically placed, but once placed everything works as expected.  
* Fix for range target auto select config not working.

## v0.1.1
Fixes a bug in better rolls spellcasting.
Fixed a couple of localisation omissions.
If you have merge cards on for better rolls the saving throw results are not displayed - diable merge card for better rolls.
